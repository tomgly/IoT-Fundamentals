### 🚀 Project 2: Spaceship Interface

**Description:**  
In this project, your Arduino is going to star in a science fiction movie! 
Now that you understand the basics of electronics, it's time to start controlling things with the Arduino. In this project, a control panel lights up when you press a button. This project uses digital inputs and outputs, variables, and basic Arduino code.

### ❤️ Project 3: Love-o-Meter

**Description:**  
In this project, you will turn the Arduino into a love machine!
Use a temperature sensor to measure your skin temperature, and register how hot you really are. Even though the Arduino is a digital tool, it can interpret signals from an analog input, like the temperature sensor, using the built in Analog-to-Digital (ADC) converter, accessed through the analog pins.

### 🌈 Project 4: Color Mixing Lamp

**Description:**  
In this project, you will create a lamp that changes its color depending on the room's lighting conditions. 
Shine red and blue light on a set of three light sensors, and the LED will turn purple! This project uses three analog inputs and you will watch data from the sensor in the "serial monitor."

### 😊 Project 5: Mood Cue

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will use a servo motor to make a gauge that points out what mood you are in today! 
The servo is a special kind of motor that can go to a specific position and stay there. This project also uses a potentiometer, connected to an analog input, to control the position of the servo.

### 🎶 Project 6: Light Theremin

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIt's time to make some noise! In this project, you will make a theremin (an instrument controlled by hand motion sensing) using a photoresistor and a piezo sound buzzer. 
You will be introduced to a new function that controls the tone or pitch of the buzzer.

### 🎹 Project 7: Keyboard Instrument

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will make a small musical keyboard using buttons and the piezo buzzer. 
You will use a new technique called a "resistor ladder." Each button you press will provide a different voltage to an analog input pin.

### ⏳ Project 8: Digital Hourglass

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will build a clock that turns an LED on every ten minutes. 
The clock uses the Arduino Uno's built in timer. Reset the clock the same way you would reset an hourglass: by tilting it back and forth!

### 🌪️ Project 9: Motorized Pinwheel

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will spin a colorful pinwheel using a motor! 
The motor requires high current, so using one in an Arduino project is more complex than lighting up LEDs. You will be using a new component called a transistor to control the motor.

### 🎞️ Project 10: Zoetrope

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will make a moving image using a series of still images that rotate around a spindle.
Not only will you use a motor to rotate the series of images, you will also be able to run the motor backwards using an integrated circuit called an H-bridge.

### 🔮 Project 11: Crystal Ball

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will create something similar to a magic 8 ball! 
Ask it a yes or no question, press a button, and a liquid crystal display will tell you if your future is bright. You can even write your own responses to display.

### 🔐 Project 12: Knock Lock

**Description:**  
By ArduinoMake your own secret knocking mechanism in this project! 
A piezo buzzer usually creates vibrations, but this time you will use it as an input to detect how many times someone knocks on your door. You can take things a step further and automatically open a box with a servo motor if someone knocks the right number of times!

### 🖐️ Project 13: Touchy-Feely Lamp

**Description:**  
By ArduinoIn this project, you will create a light that turns on and off when you touch a strip of conductive material. 
The switch works based on capacitive sensing - your skin becomes part of the circuit!
